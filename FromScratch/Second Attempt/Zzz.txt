	patch notes
	********************************************************

5.1------------------------------------------------------------------

	Bugfixes
		attack results/defend results appearing several hundred lines below where they should
		every players defensive bonus always being zero, and their offensive bonus being wrong (oops)
		bleed can now be bandaged properly

	Changes
		HP skill does much more now
		Monsters are easier to hit, and less likely to instantly splat someone 
		Terms 'damage' and 'harm' differentiated to make explanations easier
		*Easier to manage effects now, because they are filtered by character
		Armor is way better now

	Additions
		Extra detailed attack/defend results for last attack and defence
			****people felt like they had no idea what the combat calculations were doing. This should help.	
				
		Nick has a control panel for monster attacks, and now pretty much runs the entirety of what monsters do.

		Weapon, armor, and shield data available online
			****again, to help you understand what is going on. Also, to help the balance of the game. Suggestions welcome.

		CHANNELLING BURN

	Comments
		9 people, nobody picked a bow
		you need armor, or reflex, or a lot of defensive bonus and a big weapon, or you will die! 
					(all three will make you very tough)
		endurance skill was commonly picked, but its mostly for casters.
		different effects should really, really be different spells.




	5.2---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Bugfixes
		Low stamina doesnt bug out

	Changes
		Spells still hit reliably, but do much less damage. In general...
			Big weapon+reflex	beats heavy armor
			Heavy armor			beats spellcaster
			Spellcaster			beats heavy weapon+reflex

			using a shield makes you harder to hit, but you'll do less damage

	Additions
		Yall can cast your own spells now! Woo!

	Comments


	5.3-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Bugfixes
		Fixed bug that removes all spells from a players spell list when that player's stats
			are updated. Spells should work now?

	Changes
		Bleed now deteriorates over time. E.G. If it does 3 harm to you this round, itll do 2 the next,
		then one, then itll be gone.
		Impairment on the other hand, is going to stick around, even between sessions. Healing items and
		spells are v important.
		Channelling burn is functional now

	Additions
		

	Comments
		Still a bunch of confusion in the last session about exactly what players can and cant do.
		There are documents in the drive that are meant to be read! Character Creation, Combat Notes,
		Spells and Spellcasting.... all of these are full of good info. Please tell your friendly GM if
		anything is unclear, or if you feel something should be added to the docs.



	5.4-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Bugfixes
		Combat testing fixes


	Changes
		Spellcasters do more damage than the last patch, but not as much as before the nerf

	Additions
		Links in char sheets to weapon/spell/shield/armor info
		Added Ninja Notes! For all your secret-message-sending needs
			Now stealing from dualikos is easier than ever
		Silent/Passive Perception
			We will ask for fewer perception rolls now... but be scared when
			we start rolling d20s
			Your sneak rolls are also much more standardized now
		New Output for spells on the char sheet; you can see what effects your
			spells are causing now

	Comments
		VERY likely to be some bugs, since so many finnicky features just got added
		Some features (especially ninja notes) work in a somewhat counter-intuitive fashion, srry


	5.5-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Bugfixes
		Random stamina loss partially fixed, more to come
		Random extra attacks partially fixed, more to come

	Changes

	Additions

	Comments

	5.6-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Bugfixes

	Changes

	Additions
		Enchantments! This is a big hairy update. You'll se some new things happening, but
			its very little compared to the number of extra things that are happening "under
			the hood". Expect bugs, Im afraid. Oof.
		Creature types for all characters and enemies.

	Comments

	5.7-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Bugfixes
		MAJOR improvements to google writes. As with all changes and fixes, this may generate
			more bugs, but nevertheless we can expect the process of writing out to google sheets
			to take about half the time it did before. Also, running out of writes and getting cut
			off is MUCH less likely now. Woo.
	Changes
		It is now possible for any character to make an attack with any weapon. This is primarily
			to expedite the use of consumable or found items (say, throwing a random bee at someone)
			but it is now possible to change the weapon you'd like to use slightly later in the
			calculation. Mostly, you can come up with stuff on the fly and its not a headache for me.
			Essentially, annouce the attack you'd like to make, the GM will let you know what bonuses
			to use, and then input your attack as though you were using one of your normal weapons.
	Additions
		Loot tables are added, expect a lot of random drops and more specific items to be found in
			shops. 
		Support for additional attacks implemented. You may now use double strike and etc.
			Please read the combat document!
		Added items! These carry many useful effects, and will be available for purchase, or as
			random drops.
		Weapons now carry enchantments, and magical weapons may have fairly fancy effects now
		Enchantments given the ability to accept parameters, meaning it is now possible to
			write a single enchantment and then give it to multiple targets at a different
			power level each time (you have now have a 'level 3' thorns enchantment)
		Stun is a meta-effect now, and refers to a negative value of 'focus' generated by 'trauma'
	Comments
		A lot of improvements on my end this time around, things should go more smoothly and faster.
